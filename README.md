1.Rule Engine with AST 
Overview 
This project implements a Rule Engine that evaluates user attributes against defined rules using an 
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It leverages Spring Boot and MongoDB for data storage and RESTful API 
services. 
Project Structure 
The project consists of several key components: 
1. Rule Engine Application: The main entry point for the Spring Boot application. 
2. Models: Classes representing the data structures for applications, evaluations, and rules. 
3. Repositories: Interfaces for interacting with the MongoDB database. 
4. Service: Contains the logic for evaluating rules against user data. 
5. Controller: RESTful endpoints for managing rules. 
File Descriptions 
1. Rule Engine Application 
File Name: RuleEngineApplication.java 
• The main application class that starts the Spring Boot application. 
2. Application Model 
File Name: Application.java 
• Represents user applications with attributes and associated rules. 
• Contains fields for: 
o id: Unique identifier. 
o name: Application name. 
o attributes: User attributes (e.g., age, salary). 
o associatedRules: List of rule IDs linked to the application. 
o evaluationStatus: Current evaluation status. 
3. Evaluation Model 
File Name: Evaluation.java 
• Represents evaluations of rules against user data. 
• Contains fields for: 
o id: Unique identifier. 
o userId: ID of the user being evaluated. 
o ruleId: ID of the rule applied. 
o result: Boolean result of the evaluation. 
o evaluationDetails: Detailed evaluation results. 
o createdAt: Timestamp of when the evaluation was created. 
4. Rule Model 
File Name: Rule.java 
• Represents a rule in the system. 
• Contains fields for: 
o id: Unique identifier. 
o name: Name of the rule. 
o description: Description of the rule. 
o ast: AST representation of the rule logic. 
o createdAt and updatedAt: Timestamps for rule creation and updates. 
5. MongoDB Configuration 
File Name: application.properties or application.yml 
• Configures the connection to MongoDB with the database name set to ruleengine. 
6. Rule Repository 
File Name: RuleRepository.java 
• Interface for CRUD operations on the Rule model using MongoDB. 
7. Rule Engine Logic 
File Name: RuleEngine.java 
• Contains the logic for evaluating a rule’s AST against user data. 
• Evaluates conditions based on operators (AND, OR) and comparators (> , < , ==). 
8. Evaluation Repository 
File Name: EvaluationRepository.java 
• Interface for CRUD operations on the Evaluation model using MongoDB. 
9. Rule Controller 
File Name: RuleController.java 
• RESTful controller to manage rules. 
• Provides endpoints to fetch and manage rules. 
How to Run the Application 
1. Clone the Repository: 
bash 
Copy code 
git clone <repository-url> 
cd ruleengine 
2. Set Up MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible at localhost:27017. 
3. Build the Application: Use Maven to build the project: 
bash 
Copy code 
mvn clean install 
4. Run the Application: Execute the application: 
bash 
Copy code 
mvn spring-boot:run 
5. Access the API: Open your browser or an API client (like Postman) and access: 
bash 
Copy code 
http://localhost:8080/api/rules 
Conclusion 
This Rule Engine project demonstrates the use of Spring Boot and MongoDB to create a flexible rule 
evaluation system. The modular structure of the codebase makes it easy to extend and maintain, 
providing a robust foundation for future enhancements or integrations.
