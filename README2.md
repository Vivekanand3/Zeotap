2. Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring 
Overview 
This project implements a real-time data processing system for monitoring weather conditions across 
multiple cities. It retrieves current weather data and generates hourly aggregates, daily summaries, 
and alerts based on predefined thresholds. The application utilizes the Open Weather Map API for 
data retrieval and employs Java for processing. 
Project Structure 
The project consists of several key components: 
1. Weather Data Model: Represents the structure of weather data retrieved from the API. 
2. Main Application Class: Initiates data retrieval and processing for various cities. 
3. Weather Aggregator: Aggregates weather data over time to generate summaries. 
4. Weather Service: Handles the retrieval of forecast data. 
5. Alert Service: Monitors weather conditions and triggers alerts. 
6. Maven Configuration: Manages project dependencies. 
File Descriptions 
1. Weather Data Model 
File Name: WeatherData.java 
• Represents the structure of the weather data received from the Open Weather Map API. 
• Contains nested classes for Main, Wind, and Weather to encapsulate relevant weather 
attributes. 
2. Main Application Class 
File Name: WeatherApp.java 
• The main entry point for the application. 
• Sets up the Open Weather Map API URL and API key. 
• Iterates over a list of cities to fetch and display their current weather data. 
3. Weather Aggregator 
File Name: WeatherAggregator.java 
• Responsible for storing weather data for each city and generating daily summaries. 
• Calculates average, maximum, and minimum temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
4. Weather Service 
File Name: WeatherService.java 
• Retrieves weather forecasts using the Open Weather Map API's /forecast endpoint. 
• Similar to the current weather data retrieval but for a 5-day/3-hour forecast. 
5. Maven Configuration 
File Name: pom.xml 
• Configures project dependencies, including HTTP Client for API requests and Gson for JSON 
parsing. 
6. Alert Service 
File Name: AlertService.java 
• Monitors weather data for defined alert thresholds (e.g., high temperatures or low 
temperatures). 
• Provides a mechanism to check conditions and print alert messages. 
How to Run the Application 
1. Clone the Repository: 
bash 
Copy code 
git clone <repository-url> 
cd weather-monitoring 
2. Set Up Open Weather Map API: Obtain an API key from Open Weather Map and replace 
your_api_key in WeatherApp.java. 
3. Build the Application: Use Maven to build the project: 
bash 
Copy code 
mvn clean install 
4. Run the Application: Execute the application: 
bash 
Copy code 
java -cp target/weather-monitoring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar WeatherApp 
5. View Weather Data: The application will print the current weather data and any alerts to the 
console for each city specified in WeatherApp.java. 
Conclusion 
This real-time data processing system for weather monitoring provides a comprehensive framework 
for retrieving and analysing weather data. The modular design makes it easy to extend and adapt, 
allowing for the addition of new features, such as more complex alerting systems or additional data 
sources. The combination of data aggregation and alert mechanisms ensures that users can stay 
informed about significant weather changes.
